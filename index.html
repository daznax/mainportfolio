    <h1>Hello World! My name is Matthew Gierl.</h1>
    <p class="mainPage">I am a Technical Services Engineer at Epic. Welcome to my personal website! I was born and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin, but knew that I wanted to make an impact on the world around me by being part of something bigger than myself. Below are a few things I've done to accomplish that:
        <ol>
            <li>I joined the Wisconsin Army National Guard during my first semester of college in 2017. I deployed to the Middle East soon after, and found myself part of a mission that aimed to protect the citizens of war-torn nations as well as build relationships with foreign partners. Throughout my 6-year military career, I was able to meaningfully contribute to both my organization and others by educating soldiers on Equal Opportunity and Substance Abuse.</li>
            <li>I interned as a social worker working to assist adults who were experiencing crises. I learned that there are many people in this world who feel that they have no place to turn, which can lead them to even more destructive paths. I was able to assist individuals and families with getting to the resources that they needed, as well as acted as a resource when necessary.</li>
            <li>I conducted research in the field of psychology during my undergraduate studies, focusing on global wellness matters. Specifically, I designed and conducted a study that provided mental health organizations in Rwanda with new ways to target symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. </li>
            <li>I began working at Epic because we have a focus on increasing the quality of healthcare. It is incredibly fulfilling to know that the work I do can have a direct impact on the quality of life of someone who needs healthcare services. We also make a profound impact on the Madison, Wisconsin community by conducting food drives and assisting research facilities with blazing new trails in healthcare solutions.</li>
        </ol>
