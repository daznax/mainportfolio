    <p>Welcome to my projects page! Below are some projects that I've worked on, including links to the GitHub repositories:</p>
    <table style="width: 70%; text-align: left;">
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 15%;">Project Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>GitHub</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Road Trip Games</td>
            <td>My  wife's family has a host of games that they play in the car on long road trips. I thought it would be fun to have some of them available in the car so that we could play and track our progress. I'm still figuring out the best way to get this one done and want to see if I can do it in React later on.</td>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/daznax/road-trip-games"><img src="./assets/images/external link arrow.png" alt="External Link" width="45"></a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Global Poker Session Logger</td>
            <td>A web application for logging and analyzing online poker sessions, built with JavaScript and HTML buttons since Global Poker doesn't allow that tracking to be done automatically.</td>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/daznax/GPSessionLogger"><img src="./assets/images/external link arrow.png" alt="External Link" width="45"></a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Simple Card Counter</td>
            <td>A simple card counting application built with JavaScript and basic HTML buttons. Created this for fun when a buddy of mine asked if it was possible.</td>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/daznax/SimpleCardCounter/tree/main"><img src="./assets/images/external link arrow.png" alt="External Link" width="45"></a></td>
