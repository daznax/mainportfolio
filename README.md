# mainportfolio
Main webpage to host links to my other pages and current resume. 
This will be developed and updated over time as I:
 - Code more of my own projects for random things
 - Get better at writing code in general
 - Have time to update things

It's unlikely that I'll go back and improve my early projects though, 
so they'll pay some omage to my beginnings.
